# Uni-Adapter
This repository is the official implementation of the AAAI 2026 paper ["Adapt-As-You-Walk Through the Clouds: Training-Free Online Test-Time Adaptation of 3D Vision-Language Foundation Models"](http://arxiv.org/link).

🚧 **Code Release Notice**

The code and pretrained checkpoints are currently being prepared for public release.  
Please stay tuned — the full implementation will be made available **soon**.


## Overview

3D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have shown strong generalization and zero-shot recognition capabilities in open-world point cloud processing tasks. However, these models often underperform in practical scenarios where data are noisy, incomplete, or drawn from a different distribution than the training data. To address this, we propose **Uni-Adapter**, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs—improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs.

## Motivation

Existing test-time adaptation methods either depend on computationally expensive parameter updates or rely on high-confidence samples that fail to capture the full diversity of 3D structures. To address these limitations, this work introduces a training-free, prototype-based adaptation framework designed to enhance reliability and stability under challenging and heterogeneous test conditions.

### Datasets
1. The folder structure of used datasets should be organized as follows.
```sh
    
  |----data   
      |----modelnet40_c
      |----shapenet_c
      |----scanobjnn_c
